# Inventory Management System (Front End)

## What is this?
This is a webapp where users can sign up and keep track of their inventory. Users can invite other members to a "lab" where all users can see and edit inventory. Some notable features: Alert users to items with low stock, charts show usage history of all items, request orders for an item.

## What did I learn?
This was my first project using Redux. Learned how to understand and use base Redux, and how to pair it with async API calls using Redux Thunks and Axios.
